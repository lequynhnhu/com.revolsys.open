/**
 * Implements the SFS <tt>relate()</tt> generalized spatial predicate on two {@link Geometry}s.
 * <b>
 * The class supports specifying a custom {@link BoundaryNodeRule}
 * to be used during the relate computation.
 * <p>
 * If named spatial predicates are used on the result {@link IntersectionMatrix}
 * of the RelateOp, the result may or not be affected by the
 * choice of <tt>BoundaryNodeRule</tt>, depending on the exact nature of the pattern.
 * For instance, {@link IntersectionMatrix#isIntersects()} is insensitive
 * to the choice of <tt>BoundaryNodeRule</tt>,
 * whereas {@link IntersectionMatrix#isTouches(int, int)} is affected by the rule chosen.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> custom Boundary Node Rules do not (currently)
 * affect the results of other {@link Geometry} methods (such
 * as {@link Geometry#getBoundary}.  The results of
 * these methods may not be consistent with the relationship computed by
 * a custom Boundary Node Rule.
